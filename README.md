# LC-Fr-Meter-for-ESP32
V1 of LC+Resonance Frequency Meter for ESP32

 I've searched for a while for ESP32 based LC ( Induction / Capacitance ) meter but seems like everyone were arduino based.
So.. I've created one which actually looks better than the rest ;)
It's based on LM393N but You could replace it with similar.
In the github - you can get the full EAGLE PCB single layer optimized board and the circuit with a few libraries which I've created as well, and the demo project.
ENJOY ! :) ...

*** NOTE that as better the quality and smaller is the tolerance of the capacitor - the better readings you will get.
*** It is used 10 nF 10% capacitor. If You have other one, or you need to measure higher or lower inductances - change the capacitor, and reflect it's changes inside the code.
